definition for devs:
	blockchain: set of protocols and encryption technology, for securely storing data on a distributed network

for business:
	distributed ledger and technology underlying the explosion of new digital currencies

> decentralised - with protocols, cryptography and computer code

> can form peer networks with trust, including global networks


Blockchain combines cryptography and distributed computing

blockchain: secure distributed database
database consists of string of blocks containing data, each of which is encrypted with unique identifier called hash

mining computers make such blocks(entry in database) and broadcast it to the network

> to make an entry on database, consensus of the systems on network is needed

> new blocks after verification go into database as permanent immutable records, added to the countless blocks connected in the chain - proper linear order

> each block is built on the hash value of previous block; one is changed then all other forward block will be altered. this works to make the blockchain tamper proof

>> this was just first gen blockchain, simply worked as database
>> 2nd gen - execute any code on blockchain, evolving to become globally distributed cloud computing infrastructure


DISTRIBUTED LEDGER
> permanent and secure database
> record or transaction of value
>> consensus of replicated, shared and synchronised digital data, geogarphically dispursed, without centralised data storage

> can be used for any form of asset registry, like inventory or monetary transaction
assets: car, home, currency, pattents, votes, identity, health data, etc

> replace private databases, with one shared, trusted and accessible with all involved parties

>> thus removing third party centralised institutes: which may be inefficient- huge border friction, redundancy, arbitrage, resources wasted on competition


SMART CONTRACTS(2nd gen blockchain)
> computer code stored inside a blockchain
> store(encode) contractual agreement, 
> self executing, with terms of agreement or operation directly written in lines of code
> these containers take input and triggers certain output(events)
> automates many basic operations on the network
> removes need for third parties
> tamper proof, trusted, execute automatically



>> Blockchain: paradigm for- discovery, valuation, and transfer of all discrete units of value and the development of distributed organizations via token market systems
>> token: quantified unit of value, recorded on blockchain. can be anything for eg. likes on social media, currency, etc

> token networks: autonomous, independent nodes, but through incentive structures and signalling system of the market self organise to create emergent coordination and thus a distributed management system
FOR EG: 
	CLEAN AIR TOKEN-
		anyone providing service that contributes to clean air may earn CLEAN AIR token
		those who pollute have to pay in CLEAN AIR token
	no central authority or clean air act, we have TOKEN MARKET that works to create signals that align people's incentives of growing and maintaing underlying resource

>> blockchain: enables us to design incentive structures in form of token economy, converting centralised organisations into distributed market via token economics
> could trigger human coordination on much larger scale, like never before
>> blockchain: has capacity to coordinate a network of autonomous nodes towards maintaining a shared infrastructure, through design of incentive systems(just like traditional domain of economics)

>> blockchain, by merging new information networks with institutional structure that sit on top of them, through adding layer of trust and value exchange, strengthens the capacity of the networks as a new mode of organising society and economy.
> can work with other tech to redesign and reconceptualize virtually every aspect of society, based on networks of autonomous nodes that are incentivised to collaborate.
